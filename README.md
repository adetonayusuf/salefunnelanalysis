## Overview

Following its official launch, LearnX rolled out an extensive marketing campaign, with different strategies including giving out free coupons to access paid courses & programs. This campaign strategy was successful in creating a buzz in various tech communities, and drew the attention of many users curious about LearnX courses. 

 
However, despite a significant number of users exploring courses, LearnX notices a disparity when it comes to the final enrollment numbers. In other words, while many people were seen exploring courses on LearnX, only few people enrolled on the platform.

 
This is a significant problem for LearnX, as it is preventing the company from reaching its full potential. It is also a costly problem, as LearnX is investing resources into marketing and acquiring new leads, only to lose them at the enrollment stage.

## Rationale For The Project
Sales funnel analysis provides a way to see how many people are taking each step on their way to buying from you. It helps you find where people are getting stuck and make changes to improve your sales process.

For example, you might find that a lot of people are visiting your website but not adding shoes to their cart. This could either mean that your website is not doing a good job of convincing people to buy your shoes, or itâ€™s too complex to navigate. Once you know where people are getting stuck, you can make changes to improve your sales process. 

For LearnX, analyzing the sales funnel in the application process can help identify where users are dropping off, take actions to optimize its sales funnel, and  increase the number of students who enroll in its courses.

## Aim Of The Project
The main objective of this project is to analyze the course application funnel of LearnX, and finding out why users find it difficult to transition from course exploration to successful application.

 Identify the points where users typically drop out of the enrollment process. 
 Prepare a presentation slide documenting the insights. 
 Provide recommendations to optimize the sales funnel and increase conversion rates.

## Project Scope

Data Aggregation: Collect all necessary data and connect to power  BI

Data Wrangling: Wrangle the data and transform into a format needed for the analysis

Analysis & Visualization: Analyze data, define KPIs, and visualize it in Power BI

Report Presentation: Prepare a presentation slide to present analysis findings

## Dashboard & Findings
After importing the csv files into power query. I merged all the tables into a single and extract only the page columns for each tables. After then I converted the null values on all columns to zero and values of the pages columns to 1. I loaded only the merged table into power BI and carry out some analysis to understand the data better.
